Math

'Small minds discuss persons. Average minds  discuss events. Great minds discuss ideas. Really great minds discuss mathematics.'</p>
    <h2>Science</h2>
      <p>It's impossible to imagine our modern lives without science. Just think... we'd have no electricity, no cell phones or internet, no medicine, primitive transport infrastructure, unsafe buildings and bridges... it would be like living in the Middle Ages.In our department we are passionate about encouraging and inspiring the next generaton of scientists, doctors, nurses and engineers.  We strive to provide a hands-on experience because we believe science is a process, not just a body of knowledge to memorize. Instead we want to engage students creativity and innovation by offering open-ended challenges and more complex problems.  </p>
      <h2>Social Studies</h2>
      <p>
      Social studies, as defined in the BC curriculum, is a multidisciplinary subject that draws from the social sciences and humanities to study human interaction and natural and social environments. The overarching goal of social studies is to develop thoughtful, responsible, active citizens who are able to acquire the requisite information to consider multiple perspectives and to make reasoned judgments. The Social Studies curriculum provides students with opportunities as future citizens to critically reflect upon events and issues in order to examine the present, make connections with the past, and consider the future. </p>

      Info Tech
      </h2>
      <p>
      	Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have turned local communities into global communities. The kind of education that prepares students for this global community has technology as an integral part of its core. A technology-rich education enables students to bridge cultural and geographical distances around specific tasks, projects, information gathering and relationship building. It makes all subjects more meaningful to students and more adequately prepares them for the world in which they will live and work.
